        "github.py": "`github.py` is a Python script that provides functionality to clone a GitHub repository and retrieve the contents of all files within the cloned repository. The `is_github_url` function validates if a given URL is a valid GitHub repository URL. The main `get_repo` function clones the specified GitHub repository, traverses through all files in the cloned directory using `os.walk`, and returns a dictionary containing file paths and their contents.",
        "server/serveStatic.py": "The provided code, 'serveStatic.py', is a simple web server built using the Bottle framework that serves static files from a specified directory. The 'serveStatic' function handles routing for the root path and nested paths, serving index.html files for directories. However, the code lacks authentication and authorization mechanisms, and may be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks if the file path is not properly sanitized.",
        "server/www/script.js": "The script.js file contains code that creates a glitch effect on a text element by randomly replacing characters with numbers or symbols at a specified interval. It utilizes the randomizeText() function to generate a new string with randomly replaced characters and updates the glitchText element with the modified content. The code leverages JavaScript's built-in methods like split(), map(), join(), Math.random(), and String.fromCharCode() to achieve the desired effect.",
        "server/__init__.py": "`__init__.py` exports two functions: `serveStatic` for serving static files and `api` for handling API routes. It likely implements routing mechanisms, middleware functions, and request handling for different HTTP methods. Security considerations include input validation, authentication, authorization, and serving content over HTTPS.",
        "server/api.py": "The file 'api.py' implements a web API for the Wraith application, allowing users to scan and process GitHub repositories. The 'scan()' function handles the '/api/scan' route, retrieving the repository URL from the request and calling 'get_repo()' from the 'github' module to fetch the files. It then processes the repository using 'process_repository()' from the 'main' module. The API includes error handling and input validation for secure operation.",
        "main.py": "1) The main.py script generates comprehensive documentation for code repositories using AWS Bedrock AI, supporting multiple programming languages and intelligent code truncation. 2) It implements caching, concurrent processing, and respects .gitignore patterns to improve efficiency and performance. 3) The script integrates with AWS Bedrock AI service, boto3, tree-sitter, pathspec, and bottle libraries for its core functionality."
