# Python Code Documentation
**Single-sentence overview:** This code provides functionality to clone a GitHub repository and retrieve the contents of all files within the cloned repository.

**Key technical components:**

- `is_github_url(url)`: Function to validate if a given URL is a valid GitHub repository URL.
- `get_repo(github_url, clone_dir)`: Main function to clone a GitHub repository and return a dictionary containing file paths and contents.

**Critical algorithms/patterns:**

- Regular expression pattern matching to validate GitHub URLs.
- Directory traversal using `os.walk` to iterate through all files in the cloned repository.
- Exception handling for potential errors during cloning and file reading.

**Security considerations:**

- No apparent security considerations for the provided functionality.

**Core dependencies and integration points:**

- `shutil` (Python standard library): For directory operations (removing and creating directories).
- `os` (Python standard library): For path manipulation and directory traversal.
- `git` (GitPython library): For cloning GitHub repositories.
- `re` (Python standard library): For regular expression pattern matching.
