# Python Code Documentation
# File Overview

A simple web server using the Bottle framework to serve static files from a directory.

## Key Components

1. `route` decorator: Maps URL paths to Python functions.
2. `static_file` function: Serves static files from the specified root directory.
3. `ROOT` constant: The root directory for serving static files.
4. `serveStatic` function: The main route handler for serving static files.

## Algorithms/Patterns

1. URL path handling: The `serveStatic` function handles root path (`/`) and nested paths (`/<filepath:path>`).
2. Index file detection: If the path is a directory, it appends `index.html` to serve the index file.

## Security Considerations

1. No authentication or authorization mechanisms.
2. Potential directory traversal vulnerability if `filepath` is not sanitized.

## Dependencies/Integration Points

1. Bottle framework for routing and serving static files.
2. Operating system for file system operations.
