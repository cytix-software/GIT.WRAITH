# Python Code Documentation

## This is a Python script for generating comprehensive documentation for code repositories using AWS Bedrock AI.

### Key Components:

1. **`LANGUAGE_CONFIG`**: A dictionary containing configuration for different programming languages, including file extensions, comment patterns, and section/block patterns.
2. **`compute_file_hash`**: A function to compute the hash of a file, handling large files by hashing only a sample.
3. **`compute_cache`**: A function to check a list of files against a stored JSON of hashes and return only those files that are new or have changed.
4. **`bedrock_generate`**: A function to generate text using the AWS Bedrock AI model.
5. **`get_language_config`**: A function to return a filtered language configuration based on enabled/disabled languages.
6. **`generate_documentation`**: The main function to generate comprehensive documentation for a given code file using AWS Bedrock AI.
7. **`generate_summary`**: A function to generate a concise summary of the documentation.
8. **`generate_threat_model_diagram`**: A function to generate a security-focused threat model diagram using mermaid.js flowchart syntax.
9. **`get_gitignore_spec`**: A function to load .gitignore patterns into a GitIgnoreSpec object.
10. **`truncate_code`**: A function for intelligent code truncation while preserving code structure.
11. **`should_ignore_file`**: A function to determine if a file should be ignored based on common patterns for installation and third-party files.
12. **`process_file`**: A function to process a single file, generating documentation and summaries.
13. **`process_repository`**: The main function to process all code files in a repository while respecting .gitignore rules.

### Critical Algorithms and Patterns:

1. **Concurrent Processing**: The script uses Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process multiple files concurrently, improving performance.
2. **Caching**: The script implements a caching mechanism to avoid regenerating documentation for unchanged files, improving efficiency.
3. **Intelligent Code Truncation**: The `truncate_code` function intelligently truncates code while preserving code structure, ensuring that the AI model receives well-formed code snippets.
4. **GitIgnore Handling**: The script respects .gitignore patterns when processing files, ensuring that only relevant files are processed.
5. **Language-Specific Configuration**: The script supports multiple programming languages and allows for custom language configurations.

### Security Considerations:

1. **Input Validation**: The script should validate user input, such as file paths and configuration files, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like path traversal attacks.
2. **Secure Communication**: The script communicates with the AWS Bedrock AI service, so it should ensure that the communication is secure and encrypted.
3. **Sensitive Data Handling**: The script may process sensitive code or data, so it should implement appropriate measures to protect sensitive information, such as encryption or access controls.

### Core Dependencies and Integration Points:

1. **AWS Bedrock AI Service**: The script integrates with the AWS Bedrock AI service for generating documentation and summaries.
2. **boto3**: The Python library for AWS services, used to interact with the Bedrock AI service.
3. **tree-sitter**: A library for parsing and analyzing code syntax trees, used for intelligent code truncation.
4. **pathspec**: A library for pattern matching file paths, used for handling .gitignore patterns.
5. **bottle**: A lightweight Python web framework, used for running an HTTP server (if no repository path is provided).
