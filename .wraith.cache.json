        "github.py": "The provided Python code is a script that clones a GitHub repository and extracts the contents of all files within the repository. It validates the provided GitHub URL, clones the repository to a temporary directory, recursively traverses the cloned repository, and returns a dictionary containing the relative file paths as keys and their corresponding contents as values. The script utilizes external libraries such as `git` for cloning the repository and `re` for validating the URL format.",
        "main.py": "The provided documentation describes a Python script designed to analyze code repositories and generate comprehensive documentation, summaries, and threat models. The script supports various programming languages and leverages the AWS Bedrock AI model for generating detailed documentation. It implements caching to optimize performance, generates threat model diagrams, and provides a command-line interface and an HTTP server for accessing the generated content. The documentation covers key components, algorithms, security considerations, and dependencies of the script.",
        "server/__init__.py": "The provided code is a Python module that exports two components: `serveStatic` for serving static files and `api` for implementing an API. The `serveStatic` component likely handles serving static assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, while the `api` component exposes an API for communication between systems or components. Security considerations include proper access controls, input validation, and following secure coding practices for both components.",
        "server/api.py": "The provided code is a Python web application built with the Bottle framework, exposing a RESTful API endpoint `/api/scan` that accepts a GitHub repository URL. It retrieves the source code files from the provided repository, processes them using external functions, and returns the processed result as the API response. The code performs basic input validation and error handling, and integrates with GitHub for repository access.",
        "server/serveStatic.py": "The provided code sets up a simple web server using the Bottle micro web framework in Python to serve static files from a specified directory. It defines a function `serveStatic` that maps URL paths to the corresponding files in the root directory, handling directory indexing and serving the requested files. While straightforward, the code lacks input validation and sanitization, potentially exposing security vulnerabilities like directory traversal and serving sensitive files.",
        "server/www/script.js": "The provided code creates a glitch text effect by randomly replacing characters with numbers or symbols at a specified interval. It retrieves the target text element, generates a modified string with randomized characters, and updates the element's content. The effect is achieved through array manipulation, random number generation, and character encoding techniques. While the code itself does not have major security vulnerabilities, proper input sanitization and performance considerations should be taken into account when integrating it into a larger application."
