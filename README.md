## Overview

**GIT.WRAITH** is a next-generation code intelligence tool designed for security engineers and DevSecOps teams. It analyzes the **structure and source code of entire repositories**, automatically generating **high-level documentation** to support **threat modeling**, **security testing**, and **risk analysis** workflows.

Leveraging cutting-edge **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, GIT.WRAITH doesn't just parse code — it understands how your application behaves, where logic flaws may emerge, and how those flaws can be exploited.

Unlike other tools, GIT.WRAITH can understand your codebase, providing genuine insights that are useful to security and development teams.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Code Understanding**  
  Uses LLMs to semantically analyze your codebase for logic, flow, and intent.

- 📂 **Repository Mapping**  
  Builds a clear, structured overview of your application’s architecture and logic layers.

- 🔐 **Threat Modeling Diagrams & Descriptions**  
  Automatically generate bespoke threat models based on real code patterns.

- 🧾 **Security-Ready Documentation**  
  Outputs easy to understand markdown documentation for security engineers and DevSecOps teams.

- 🧭 **Actionable Risk Insight**  
  Highlights potential business logic flaws and explains how security engineers can validate or exploit them.

## Why Use GIT.WRAITH?

Traditional static analysis tools miss the **intent** behind code — and attackers know it.

GIT.WRAITH bridges that gap by:
- Understanding how your code **should** behave
- Flagging where logic is **ambiguous, insecure, or exploitable**
- Documenting it in a way **humans can act on**

Whether you’re building a threat model from scratch or trying to validate what flaws are possible, **GIT.WRAITH brings transparency to complex systems** — fast.

---

## Example Output

When run on a target repository, GIT.WRAITH produces:

- ✅ Markdown (High Level) Documentation Summarising Key Files and Application Features.
- ✅ Threat Modeling Diagrams.
- ✅ Suggested Workflow/Test Cases for Validating Threats 
- ✅ Theat Breakdown of Modelled Threats.

## How It Works
TO/DO
1. 🔍 **Clone & Analyze**  
   Point GIT.WRAITH at a Git repository — it crawls the file tree, detects application structure, and feeds code to the underlying LLM engine.

2. 🧩 **Interpret & Generate**  
   It infers business logic, maps out trust boundaries, and produces documentation from both security and engineering perspectives.

3. 📤 **Deliver & Iterate**  
   Export results in formats usable by security testers, developers, and compliance teams alike.
