# Bash Code Documentation
# Overview

This document provides a high-level description of a bash script that sets up a Python virtual environment and installs required packages.

# What Does the Code Do?

The code creates a new Python virtual environment, activates it, and installs required packages from a `requirements.txt` file. This allows developers to work on a project without interfering with other projects or system-wide Python packages.

# Functionality Provided

The script provides the following functionality:

1. Installs the `virtualenv` package if it is not already installed.
2. Creates a new Python virtual environment named `venv`.
3. Activates the virtual environment.
4. Installs required packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

# Key Components

The key components of the code are:

1. `pip install virtualenv`: This command installs the `virtualenv` package if it is not already installed.
2. `python -m virtualenv venv`: This command creates a new Python virtual environment named `venv`.
3. `venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`: This command installs required packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

# Using the Code

To use the code, simply copy and paste it into a file with a `.sh` extension and run it in a terminal. The script will automatically create a new virtual environment and install required packages.

Note: The script must be run in a directory that contains a `requirements.txt` file.
